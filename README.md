# JinriTV Streamer Matchmakers Project
Creating a website to match the streamer of your type

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### To install

**Note** This guide is for Windows OS only, maybe if someone wants to make a guide for other systems it would be appreciated.
This guide will show how to install these software:

* **Node.js** - The backend environment 

* **MySQL** - The database

## Installing Node.js

Start with downloading Node.js version LTS from the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) downloads page. Run the installer and leave most settings at default. Make sure that **npm package manager** is set to be installed.

After installation, verify that Node was successfully installed by opening up a Command Prompt and typing

```node -v```

It should display the version number of Node installed (v12.18.3).

## Installing MySQL

Now download the [MySQL Installer](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/), choose the "MySQL Installer for Windows". When the installer asks you what to install, you can select:

* **Server Only**: We only need the MySQL server so this is all we need to install.

or

* **Developer Default**: this will install more than what we need, but it will include other useful tools such as Workbench, which is a GUI for interacting with the databases.


## Setting up the MySQL database

After installation, it will begin the process to setup the database. Keep all settings at default until the **Accounts and Roles** section, where we will setup 2 users:
* **Root**: this is the super admin account and it is not recommended to develop with this account
* **Dev account**: the account we will use to develop with

Once you get to the **Account and Roles** section: Setup your password for the root account here. Make sure to keep this password secure.

Then create a new Role, this will be your dev account that you will login to the database with:
![create user](https://github.com/glottsi/Streamer-match-makers/blob/master/guide_images/Untitled.png)

Now it will ask if you want MySQL to be configured as a service. This means you will be able to start and stop the database server through the windows services interface. Enter a name for the service, and decide if you want the database server to start every time windows starts.

![name service](https://github.com/glottsi/Streamer-match-makers/blob/master/guide_images/service.png)

Press Next and Execute to complete the installation.

After installation, if you open the Task Manager and go to the Services tab, you should be able to see the new database service running:

## Node.js and MySQL problem

It seems like the new version of MySQL's authentication doesn't work well with Node, so in order to connect to our database server, we need to run a command to change the authentication process.

They are supposed to be working on a fix but it's still not completed yet: [https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql/issues/1507](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql/issues/1507)

#### The database auth "downgrade" fix

Before we can connect to MySQL with Node, we need to downgrade the authentication system that our server uses, for our dev user.

Open your Command Prompt and run this command ```cd C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin```

Now login to the MySQL server with your root user by entering this command:

```mysql -u root -p```

and it will ask for your root password. Then you should be successfully logged into your MySQL server:

![sql login](https://github.com/glottsi/Streamer-match-makers/blob/master/guide_images/loginmysql.png)

Run this command to change the authentication method for your dev user:

```ALTER USER 'your-username'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'your-password';```

You should see `Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)`

This command tells our server to accept the kind of authentication that we use with the Node module.

## Verify Node server is working

Now we can test if our Node and MySQL connection is working correctly.

Open Command Prompt and `cd` to the location of this project, specifically the `/Node` folder. First we must install the required packages. In this folder, run the command 

`npm install`

And it should install the required packages we need (which are defined in the package.json file).

## Add your Username and Password

Edit the Username and Password in the `USER_CREDENTIALS` object in the /Node/backend/mysql.js file
![user_credentials](https://github.com/glottsi/Streamer-match-makers/blob/db_create_table/guide_images/user_cred.png)

Now to start the server run the command `npm start`

The console should now display something like 
```  streamer-matcher:server Listening on port 3000 +0ms ```

Now go to `localhost:3000` in a web browser. 

Verify there are no errors on the page, or in the console.

## Verify MySQL database server connection

On the home page, click the link called "Database", or navigate in the browser to `localhost:3000/database`

Press the 'Initialize Database' button to connect to the MySQL server and run the database creation query.

The button will turn green and a success message will display if you are successfully connected, Congrats! It will be red and display an error message if incorrect:

![server_respon](https://github.com/glottsi/Streamer-match-makers/blob/db_create_table/guide_images/initialize_db_results.png)

If you have MySQL Workbench (installable via the MySQL Installer we used to install the server), you can see what this query has created, a database called 'jinritv', and a table called 'streamers'. Right-clicking on the table and choosing the first option 'Select Rows - Limit 1000' will display the first 1000 records in the table, but now it is empty.

## Project Structure
I tried to keep the structure as simple as possible, so that anyone who wants to learn can follow along easier. Our Node server doesn't use any view engine, we are only displaying the static html file with the css and js. For now this is the simplest way, until, or if, we need to add something more.

![structre](https://github.com/glottsi/Streamer-match-makers/blob/master/guide_images/file_structure.png)

* **/backend** : this folder contains the code that will run server-side
* **/node_modules** : this folder is automatically filled when you run `npm install`, don't worry about it.
* **/public** : this folder contains our website files (html, css, and js) for all of our client-side activities. 
* **app.js** : the 'base' module that will run our server. Here we define the endpoints and serve the static pages
* **package.json** : this outlines our project and contains information such as the name and what other modules we need. When we run `npm install`, it reads the package names from the "dependancies" section and installs them for us. It also gets updated if we install any packages using `npm install package-name`. Don't worry about this file.
* **package-lock.json** : automatically generated, don't worry about it.

## Next Steps

Obvious next step: we need to actually create the database, and seed the data. This is just a sample project to test the Node and MySQL servers.
